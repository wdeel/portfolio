    # Notes: 
    # This function handles the initial registrion process for new servers. The user must provide a unique servername
    # on registration. Upon receipt of a valid registration method, this function should create a new ServerDetails object containing 
    # this server's details. This should be stored in the servers_lookuptable, using the server's name as the key associated
    # with this new value. The server should then notify all other servers about this new server. 
    # 
    # Finally, the server should send the new server all known servers and users. This can be accomplished by sending 
    # SERVER and USER messages, and RPL_TOPIC/RPL_NOTOPIC and RPL_NAMEPLY messages, that inform the new server about every other
    # known server, user, and channel. Sending SERVER and USER messages will inform the new server about all servers and users 
    # using the normal registration code, and thus requires no additional development. You will need to complete the appropriate
    # RPL handlers for RPL_TOPIC, RPL_NOTOPIC, and RPL_NAMEPLY to enable the new server to register existing channel information.
    # These RPL handlers will only be used for this functionality.
    #
    # Additionally, the server the new server registers directly with also needs to replace the ConnectionData associated with this socket
    # that was created in accept_new_connection(). It should replace ConnectionData with the new ServerDetails object.
    # The ConnectionData object can be replaced using the selector.modify command (see python docs for more detail). This allows us

    # This function allows users to send messages to other users, or to a channel. Upon receiving a message, the server
    # should first determine if this is addressed to a specific client, or to a channel. It should then forward the message
    # towards its destination. In addition to forwarding the message to other servers, each server must check to make sure 
    # if a user this message is addressed to is adjacent to it, and if so forward this message to that client. When sending
    # a message to a channel, the server must check to see if any of the users in the channel are adjacent.
    # If the server does not recognize the nick the message is addressed to, it should return a ERR_NOSUCHNICK response.
    # If the server does not recognize the channel the message is addressed to, it should return a ERR_NOSUCHCHANNEL response.
    # If the user sending the message is not part of the addressed channel, the server should return a ERR_NOSUCHCHANNEL response.
